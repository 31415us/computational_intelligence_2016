All non standard library dependencies are listed in the file
'requirements.txt'

The subfolder 'data' contains training data, test data and additional data
needed for training

Once all dependencies are installed you can simply run 'run.py' and it will
recreate our 'submission.csv', no additional setup required

the subfolder 'cnn' contains the code we used for the convolutional neural
network. It is not runnable out of the box and only there for documentation
purposes.
As mentioned in the main paper the convolutional neural net code is based on:
https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf
and the accompanying blog post:
